# cyberparty-site-theme

A Zola site theme built for my own upcoming site.
This theme is built primarily for my own purposes rather than mass adoption and so features are usually added at my own whim rather than in consideration for what others may like. Regardless, it's here in case anyone wants to use, fork, or modify it for their own purposes!

## Features

- Adaptive mobile-friendly menu
- Consistent across pages (same header, only the main content panel is what changes)
- No dependencies on any external frameworks
- No JavaScript

## Credits
